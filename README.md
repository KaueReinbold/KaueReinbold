  I was always curious about technology and how that little box (sometimes heavy) was able to perform many actions and help people in so many ways. Over the years at the college, I learned more about it and understood how this world works. Year by year my curiosity kept increasing and I saw that I could help and change people's lives with my passion. That makes me very happy and excited.

  I have been working with technology since 2014, I am a professional who understands the business needs and how to achieve the objectives with agility and in a team. I love studying new technologies and figuring out new ways of solving problems. Over the years, I learned how to balance the time to market with the application's continuous improvement. At the end of the day, the most important thing is to deliver value to the business with a codebase that can be easily supported by everyone in the long run.

  I am excited about learning new ways of solving complex problems. That is why I keep myself up-to-date with the latest technologies, languages, and programming patterns.
